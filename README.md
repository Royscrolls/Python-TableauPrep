Find the input files, scripts and tableau prep flows here

The input file has been obtained from https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2020/11/2020-week-48.html . This is a great resource for Tableau prep beginners and veterans alike.
The input file has 4 tabs. I have created the flow with only the first tab (Stands) as a demo.

Before running the .py files make sure TabPy is set up on your desktop: https://help.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/prep_scripts_TabPy.htm
and the webservice is listening to the port 9004 on the localhost server.
